"""
Model
10lb force on one pedal
Pedal lever is about 9 inches long

Rotates pedals from flat to down (90 degrees)
0% resist - 1.5s (estimated)
100% resist - 6s (estimated)
Rotational mass is about ??? (units)
Assume resistance force is proportional to speed

The torque applied by the weight dissipates as the weight reaches bottom
The resistance torque is proportional to and in opposition of speed
